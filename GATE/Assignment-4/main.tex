    \item A solid block of $2.0 kg$ mass slides steadily at a velocity $V$ along a vertical wall as shown in the figure below. A thin oil film of thickness $h=0.15mm$ provides lubrication between the block and the wall. The surface area of the face of the block in contact with the oil film is $0.04 m^2$ . The velocity distribution within the oil film gap is linear as shown in the figure. Take dynamic viscosity of oil as $7\times10^{-3} Pa-s$ and acceleration due to gravity as $10 m/s^2$ . Neglect weight of the oil. The terminal velocity $V$ (in $m/s$) of the block is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to one decimal place).

    \item A tank of volume $0.05 m^3$ contains a mixture of saturated water and saturated steam at $200\degree C$.The mass of the liquid present is $8 kg$. The entropy (in $kJ/kg K$) of the mixture is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

        Property data for saturated steam and water are:

        At $200\degree C$,$p_{sat}= 1.5538 MPa$

        $v_{f} = 0.001157 m^3/kg$,$v_{g} = 0.12736 m^3/kg$

        $s_{fg} = 4.1014 kJ/kg K$, $s_{f} = 2.3309 kJ/kg K$

    \item Steam flows through a nozzle at a mass flow rate of $\dot{m}=0.1kg/s$ with a heat loss of 5 kW. The enthalpies at inlet and exit are 2500 kJ/kg and 2350 kJ/kg, respectively. Assuming
        negligible velocity at inlet $(C_1\approx0)$, the velocity $C_2$ of steam (in $m/s$) at the nozzle exit is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

    \item An engine working on air standard Otto cycle is supplied with air at $0.1 MPa$ and $35\degree C$. The compression ratio is $8$. The heat supplied is $500 kJ/kg$. Property data for air: $c_p = 1.005 kJ/kg K,\,c_v = 0.718 kJ/kg K,\,R = 0.287 kJ/kg K$. The maximum temperature (in $K$) of the cycle is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to one decimal place).

    \item A plane slab of thickness $L$ and thermal conductivity $k$ is heated with a fluid on one side ($P$),and the other side ($Q$) is maintained at a constant temperature, $T_{Q}$ of $25\degree C$, as shown in the figure. The fluid is at $45\degree C$ and the surface heat transfer coefficient, $h$, is $10 W/m^2K$. The steady state temperature, $T_{P}$, (in $\degree C$) of the side which is exposed to the fluid is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

    \item The true stress $(\sigma)$ - true strain $(\varepsilon)$ diagram of a strain hardening material is shown in figure. First, there is loading up to point $\vec{A}$, i.e., up to stress of $500 MPa$ and strain of $0.5$. Then from point $\vec{A}$, there is unloading up to point $\vec{B}$, i.e., to stress of $100 MPa$. Given that the Young's modulus $E = 200 GPa$, the natural strain at point $\vec{B} (\varepsilon_{B})$ is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

    \item An orthogonal cutting operation is being carried out in which uncut thickness is $0.010 mm$, cutting speed is $130 m/min$, rake angle is $15\degree$ and width of cut is $6 mm$. It is observed that the chip thickness is $0.015 mm$, the cutting force is $60 N$ and the thrust force is $25 N$. The ratio of friction energy to total energy is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

        $$3x+5y\leq15$$
        $$4x+9y\leq8$$
        $$13x+2y\leq2$$
        $$x\geq0,y\geq0$$
        is \underline{\hspace{1cm}}.

    \item Processing times (including setup times) and due dates for six jobs waiting to be processed at a work centre are given in the table. The average tardiness (in days) using shortest processing time rule is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

    \item The schematic of an external drum rotating clockwise engaging with a short shoe is shown in the figure. The shoe is mounted at point $\vec{Y}$ on a rigid lever $\vec{XYZ}$ hinged at point $\vec{X}$. A force $F = 100 N$ is applied at the free end of the lever as shown. Given that the coefficient offriction between the shoe and the drum is $0.3$, the braking torque (in $Nm$) applied on thedrum is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

    \item Block $P$ of mass $2 kg$ slides down the surface and has a speed $20 m/s$ at the lowest point, $\vec{Q}$, where the local radius of curvature is $2 m$ as shown in the figure. Assuming $g = 10 m/s^2$  , the normal force (in $N$) at $\vec{Q}$ is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).

    \item An electrochemical machining (ECM) is to be used to cut a through hole into a $12 mm$ thick aluminum plate. The hole has a rectangular cross-section, $10 mm \times 30 mm$. The ECM operation will be accomplished in $2$ minutes, with efficiency of $90\%$. Assuming specific removal rate for aluminum as $3.44 \times 10^{-2} mm^3 /(A s)$, the current (in $A$) required is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (correct to two decimal places).
