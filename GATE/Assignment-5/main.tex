    \item The table presents the demand of a product. By simple three-months moving average method, the demand-forecast of the product for the month of September is

    \item Evaluation of $\int\limits_2^4x^3dx$ using a 2-equal-segment trapezoidal rule gives a value of \underline{\hspace{1cm}}
    
    %19
    \item A block of mass $10 kg$ rests on a horizontal floor. The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81 m/s^2$. The coefficient of static friction between the floor and the block is $0.2$. A horizontal force of $10 N$ is applied on the block as shown in the figure. The magnitude of force of friction (in $N$) on the block is \underline{\hspace{1cm}}

    \item  A cylindrical rod of diameter $10 mm$ and length $1.0 m$ is fixed at one end. The other end is twisted by an angle of $10^\degree$ by applying a torque. If the maximum shear strain in the rod is $p\times10^{-3}$, then $p$ is equal to \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (round off to two decimal places).

    %21
    \item A solid cube of side $1 m$ is kept at a room temperature of $32 ^\degree C$. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the cube material is $1\times 10^{-5}/{}^{\degree} C$ and the bulk modulus is $200 GPa$. If the cube is constrained all around and heated uniformly to $42 ^\degree C$, then the magnitude of volumetric (mean) stress (in $MPa$) induced due to heating is \underline{\hspace{1cm}}

    %22
    \item During a high cycle fatigue test, a metallic specimen is subjected to cyclic loading with a mean stress of $+140 MPa$, and a minimum stress of $-70 MPa$. The $R$-ratio (minimum stress to maximum stress) for this cyclic loading is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} (round off to one decimal place).

    %23
    \item Water flows through a pipe with a velocity given by $\vec{V} = \brak{\frac{4}{t}+x+y}\hat{j}m/s$, where $\hat{j}$ is the unit vector in the $y$ direction, $t (> 0)$ is in seconds, and $x$ and $y$ are in meters. The magnitude of total acceleration at the point $(x, y) = (1, 1)$ a $t = 2 s$ is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} $m/s^2$

    %24
    \item Air of mass $1 kg$, initially at $300 K$ and $10\,bar$, is allowed to expand isothermally till it reaches a pressure of $1\,bar$. Assuming air as an ideal gas with gas constant of $0.287 kJ/kg K$, the change in entropy of air (in $kJ/kg.K$, round off to two decimal places) is \underline{\hspace{1cm}}

    %25
    \item Consider the stress-strain curve for an ideal elastic-plastic strain hardening metal as shown in the figure. The metal was loaded in uniaxial tension starting from $\vec{O}$. Upon loading, the stress-strain curve passes through initial yield point at $\vec{P}$, and then strain hardens to point $\vec{Q}$, where the loading was stopped. From point $\vec{Q}$, the specimen was unloaded to point $\vec{R}$, where the stress is zero. If the same specimen is reloaded in tension from point $\vec{R}$, the value of stress at which the material yields again is \underline{\hspace{1cm}} $MPa$

    \item A harmonic function is analytic if it satisfies the Laplace equation.

        If $u(x,y)=2x^2-2y^2+4xy$ is a harmonic function, then its conjugate harmonic function $v(x,y)$ is

The acceleration of the car is $a$, and acceleration due to gravity is $g$. The reactions on the front wheels $(R_{f})$ and rear wheels $(R_{r})$ are given by
